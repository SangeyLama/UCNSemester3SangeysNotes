## About
This purpose of this document is to provide a useful place for me to write down
notes about for my Exam at University College of Nordjylland Computer Science 
3rd Semester 2017.  
I'll be writing notes about requirements, technologies, protocols, frameworks, etc
along with some explanation of some of the theory 
for my own benefit and also that of my group members.  
(And anyone else who stumbles across this.) 

## Semester Requirements

### Technology
