## About
This purpose of this document is to provide a useful place for me to write down
notes about for my Exam at University College of Nordjylland Computer Science 
3rd Semester 2017.  
I'll be writing notes about requirements, technologies, protocols, frameworks, etc
along with some explanation of some of the theory 
for my own benefit and also that of my group members.  
(And anyone else who stumbles across this.) 

## Semester Requirements

### Technology  
Knowledge:  
The students should have achieved knowledge of:
* Principles of design and implementation of distributed systems.
* Fundamental network concepts.  
  
Skills:  
The students should be able to:
* Include relevant technological aspects in the development of distributed systems, including:
* Central security concepts and threats.
* Use of virtualization
* Use of services and programming interface for communication
* Application of common application protocols.  

Competences:  
The students should be able to:
* Reflect on choice of infrastructure in connection with development of distributed systems.

### Programming
Knowledge:  
The students should have achieved knowledge of:
* Integration between heterogeneous components and platforms.

Skills:  
The students should be able to:
* use techniques to construct programs that support multiple concurrent users;
* design and construct programs based on collaborating processes in a distributed architecture;
* construct programs that use contemporary network technologies;
* use design patterns for distributed software architecture;
* develop software components; 
* and develop web applications.

Competencies:  
The students should be able to:
* act as professional programmers in integration projects; 
* and acquire new skills within programming language, development tools, programming techniques and 
program design.

 * Pretty much the same requirements as the previous semester. (OOP concepts, Data structures, patterns, etc)
 * Understand the .Net architecture and implement a distributed system (n-tier architecture)
 * Understand how to implement ADO. NET to access MS SQL Database
 * How to create WinForms
 * Delegates, Observer / visitor pattern (maybe?)
 * Paralellism and threads
 * WCF principles (creating a service, hosting a service, connecting clients to service references)
 * Web services (SOAP , REST, WSDL)
 * How to build a web client (either webforms or MVC)

### System Development
Knowledge:  
The students should have achieved knowledge of:
* The role of experiments as part of or a supplement to the system development method
* The role of quality criteria in the system development process and the system's final design.

Skills:  
The students should be able to:
* Model and design IT systems
* Use a suitable software architecture
* Document and communicate product and process â€“ including traceability
* Quality assure product and process
* Use suitable design patterns
* Involve users
* Design situation-specific user interfaces and choose a process model and system development method
* Work systematically on a project subject to a chosen system development method
* Plan, assess, and regulate a project
* Select and use suitable design patterns and components
* Design systems that are integrated with other systems.

Competences:  
The students should be able to:
* Participate competently in a development project
* Situationally adapt a system development method to a project
* Participate competently in a development project
* Acquire new process models and system development methods
* Reflect on and adapt processes and methods in practice.
