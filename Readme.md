## About
This purpose of this document is to provide a useful place for me to write down
notes about for my Exam at University College of Nordjylland Computer Science 
3rd Semester 2017.  
I'll be writing notes about technologies, protocols, frameworks,
and other things for my own benefits and also my group members.  
(And anyone else who stumbles across this.)
